    <h2>First steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Accept your first contract.</b> It is important to accept a contract as soon as possible. When
                starting your first contract, look for one of relatively low difficulty, preferably one under difficulty
                4. If you wish to go for higher difficulties, there are more keys to remember and it is recommended to
                use a notepad. <b>Using notepads is <u>not</u> considered cheating.</b></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Complete the contract.</b> Your contract will take place in the second column, the decryption terminal. The terminal will give you a string of buttons to press. It is up to you to press the correct buttons in the correct order in the keypad below. If you press the correct buttons in the correct order, the reward will be granted, as listed on the contract. Keep mind of your character which will give a multiplier. <b>Remember, the contract will not be completed if you press the wrong buttons. In fact, <u>you will lose half of the promised money and same with the reputation.</u></b>
            </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Go to the shop</b> The game is not about making money, it is about survival. Head to the command terminal and enter your first command: Shop''. This will take you to the shop where you can buy supplies to survive. You can buy food, water, amongst other upgrades. <b>Remember, you will need to eat and drink to survive. If you do not eat or drink, you <u>will die.</u></b>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Keep going!</b> Keep repeating these steps. You will eventually have enough reputation to develop bonds with other factions/companies. They will help you beat the game, each faction having a different ending.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Upgrades</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To access the upgrades, use the UPGRADES'' command to open the modal for upgrades. You must have purchased the upgrades access pass in SHOP'' for 200 cash.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>What is the game about?</b> The game is about survival. You must survive in a world where you are never safe. You must fend for yourself or join a clan. The year is 3039. You'll eventually end the game with an ending achievable through joining a faction/company. The probability of this is by completing contracts and gaining reputation, and spending the reputation points on connections.
